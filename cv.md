### Summary
---------   
A little **background** story:
>My  first meeting with IT word was at the university, when i did laboratory classes in Visual Basic. I was so exited about opportunities and results in coding, so i even decide  to make my own interactive strategy game. I spend much time trying to bring my ideas with realizing this project and this was very fun. But it was a long time ago... 

Today i decided to improve my skills and already got some achievements.
I believe, that becoming knowledge in web-design, programming languages, and development can help me to realize my ideas in future projects.
